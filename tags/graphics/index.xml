      <description>Last November I started working on a toy DX12 renderer. At first my intention was to add a new backend for Milton, but after I got the first triangle going it became pretty addictive to just keep going and see where I could take it. Here&amp;rsquo;s a write-up of what I&amp;rsquo;ve got going!
My main focus has been was on API design and the core rendering API. I wanted to have an engine I could use to write small games and test apps with as few lines of code as possible.</description>
